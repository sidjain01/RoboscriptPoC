# RoboscriptPoC

## Steps for setup:
   1. Create a virtual environment with python 3. (Not important but it is a good practice to maintain versioning of the packages per application)
   2. Clone this repo in the same directory as of the virtualenv. (Not important but it will be easy to activate virtual environment everytime before starting the application)
   3. Activate the virtual env through command prompt. Run `<path-to-virtual-env>\Scripts\activate`
   4. Go to the root folder of the repo.
   5. To install all the packages needed to run the application, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
   6. Run `py server.py`.
   7. Open another command prompt, activate the virtual environment and then run `robot first.robot`.
